                    <p>
                        Lightsticks are used by fandoms to show support to groups and idols. Lightsticks are essential
                        for every concert and group event. We offer plenty of lightsticks for all your concert needs!

                        Most lightsticks are bluetooth connected and power on during concerts automatically, some can be used at anytime and have various interchangable settings. Some
                        lightsticks are larger than normal and will arrive deconstructed for safe shipping.
